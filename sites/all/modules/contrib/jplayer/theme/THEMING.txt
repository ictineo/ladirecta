The jPlayer default output uses a lot of CSS to get the player looking
respectable. This default set of CSS is based on the demonstration skin provided
at http://www.happyworm.com/jquery/jplayer/latest/demos.htm.

- THEMING -
If you want to override jpalyer.css or jplayer.js place your files under
'your_theme_directory/jplayer/'. 

! IMPORTANT !
jplayer.css and jplayer.jpg have to be in the same folder, so if you want to 
override one of them copy also the other one.  

Note that the default HTML output of jPlayer module is a standard template that
other "skins" may work with. It is highly suggest to not override the
jplayer.tpl.php file and instead build all your custom theming on top of the
default HTML through CSS.
